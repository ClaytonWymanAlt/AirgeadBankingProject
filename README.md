# AirgeadBankingProject

## Project Summary
The Airgead Banking project was a system to simulate the value of an investment given an initial deposit, monthly deposit, compounded interest rate, and a duration of years by the user. The simulation was displayed both with and without the monthly deposit over the investment period to show the difference when investing monthly vs only interest on the initial investment, and how this effected the overall value and interest of the investment.

## Personal Assessment
Personally, I consider my work on this project to be mostly without flaw. If I had to pick something to improve, it would be how I couldn't figure out how to get a "Press any key to continue" prompt to work properly, so I had to use a "Press any key and enter to continue" prompt to get the program to continue based on a user interaction. The most challenging code to write was the class files, and the method to create a secure object without a data leak. Initially I couldn't figure out how to use the secure data declarations, and only caught on once I realized the example declarations were pointers, and as such I had to use pointers to call the object methods. I think this is also the most valuable skill I applied in this project that I can work into other projects, as declaring secure data can be a general improvement to all of my projects and result in more efficient usage of data.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
Overall, I think these three aspects of the project are well covered. Maintainability and adaptability are present in using prefixes for different variables within the class to ensure that the code can be built upon in a natural way. While this also applies to the readability of the code, more important to readability is the numerous comments I used to explain why I did each portion of the project the way I did, allowing other developers and teachers to understand the code I have written.
